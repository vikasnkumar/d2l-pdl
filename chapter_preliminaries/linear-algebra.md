# Linear Algebra

By now, we can load datasets into tensors and manipulate these tensors with
basic mathematical operations.  To start building sophisticated models, we will
also need a few tools from linear algebra.  This section offers a gentle
introduction to the most essential concepts, starting from scalar arithmetic and
ramping up to matrix multiplication.

## Scalars

Most everyday mathematics consists of manipulating numbers one at a time.
Formally, we call these values _scalars_.  For example, the temperature in
Orlando, Florida is a balmy $$72$$ degrees Fahrenheit.  If you wanted to convert
the temperature to Celsius you would evaluate the expression $$c = \frac{5}{9}(f
- 32)$$, setting $$f$$ to $$72$$.  In this equation, the values $$5$$, $$9$$,
  and $$32$$ are constant scalars.  The variables $$c$$ and $$f$$ in general
represent unknown scalars.

We denote scalars by ordinary lower-cased letters (e.g., $$x$$, $$y$$, and
$$z$$) and the space of all (continuous) _real-valued_ scalars by
$$\mathbb{R}$$.  For expedience, we will skip past rigorous definitions of
_spaces_: just remember that the expression $$x \in \mathbb{R}$$ is a formal way
to say that $$x$$ is a real-valued scalar.  The symbol $$\in$$ (pronounced "in")
denotes membership in a set.  For example, $$x, y \in \{0, 1\}$$ indicates that
$$x$$ and $$y$$ are variables that can only take values $$0$$ or $$1$$.

**Scalars are implemented as tensors that contain only one element.** Below, we
assign two scalars and perform the familiar addition, multiplication, division,
and exponentiation operations.

```perl
pdl> $x = ones(1) * 3.0
pdl> $y = ones(1) * 2.0
pdl> print $x, $y
[3] [2]
pdl> print $x+$y
pdl> print $x + $y, $x * $y, $x / $y, $x ** $y
[5] [6] [1.5] [9]
```

## Vectors

For current purposes, _you can think of a vector as a fixed-length array of
scalars_.  As with their code counterparts, we call these scalars the _elements_
of the vector (synonyms include _entries_ and _components_).  When vectors
represent examples from real-world datasets, their values hold some real-world
significance.  For example, if we were training a model to predict the risk of a
loan defaulting, we might associate each applicant with a vector whose
components correspond to quantities like their income, length of employment, or
number of previous defaults.  If we were studying the risk of heart attack, each
vector might represent a patient and its components might correspond to their
most recent vital signs, cholesterol levels, minutes of exercise per day, etc.
We denote vectors by bold lowercase letters, (e.g., $$\mathbf{x}$$, $$\mathbf{y}$$,
and $$\mathbf{z}$$).

Vectors are implemented as $$1^{\textrm{st}}$$-order tensors.  In general, such
tensors can have arbitrary lengths, subject to memory limitations. **Caution**:
in Perl (and in `PDL`), as in most _reasonable_ programming languages, vector
indices start at $$0$$, also known as *zero-based indexing*, whereas in linear
algebra subscripts begin at $$1$$ (one-based indexing), in this document.

```perl
pdl> $x = sequence(3)
pdl> print $x
[0 1 2]
```

We can refer to an element of a vector by using a subscript.  For example,
$$x_2$$ denotes the second element of $$\mathbf{x}$$.  Since $$x_2$$ is a
scalar, we do not bold it.  By default, we visualize vectors by stacking their
elements vertically:

$$\mathbf{x} =\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}  \\ \vdots  \\x_{n}\end{bmatrix}.$$

Here $$x_1, \ldots, x_n$$ are elements of the vector.  Later on, we will
distinguish between such _column vectors_ and *row vectors* whose elements are
stacked horizontally.  Recall that _we access a tensor's elements via indexing_.

```perl
pdl> print $x(2)
[2]
```

To indicate that a vector contains $$n$$ elements, we write $$\mathbf{x} \in
\mathbb{R}^n$$.  Formally, we call $$n$$ the *dimensionality* of the vector.  In
code, this corresponds to the tensor's length, accessible via the `length`
function in `PDL`. The output of `length` is identical to `dims`, which is the
generic dimensionality retrieval function.  The return value of `dims` is a
tuple that indicates a tensor's length along each axis.  _Tensors with just one
axis have shapes with just one element._ We can also use the `shape` function
to return a `PDL` object with the dimensions.

```perl
pdl> print $x->length
3
pdl> print $x->dims
3
pdl> print $x->shape
[3]
```

Oftentimes, the word "dimension" gets overloaded to mean both the number of axes
and the length along a particular axis.  To avoid this confusion, we use *order*
to refer to the number of axes and *dimensionality* exclusively to refer to the
number of components.

## Matrices

Just as scalars are $$0^{\textrm{th}}$$-order tensors and vectors are
$$1^{\textrm{st}}$$-order tensors, matrices are $$2^{\textrm{nd}}$$-order tensors.
We denote matrices by bold capital letters (e.g., $$\mathbf{X}$$, $$\mathbf{Y}$$,
and $$\mathbf{Z}$$), and represent them in code by tensors with two axes.  The
expression $$\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$$ indicates that a matrix
$$\mathbf{A}$$ contains $$m \times n$$ real-valued scalars, arranged as $$m$$ rows and
$$n$$ columns.  When $$m = n$$, we say that a matrix is *square*.  Visually, we can
illustrate any matrix as a table.  To refer to an individual element, we
subscript both the row and column indices, e.g., $$a_{ij}$$ is the value that
belongs to $$\mathbf{A}$$'s $$i^{\textrm{th}}$$ row and $$j^{\textrm{th}}$$ column:

$$\mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \\ \end{bmatrix}.$$


In code, we represent a matrix $$\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$$ by a
$$2^{\textrm{nd}}$$-order tensor with shape ($$m$$, $$n$$).  _We can convert any
appropriately sized $$m \times n$$ tensor into an $$m \times n$$ matrix_ by
passing the desired shape to `reshape`. Recall that `PDL` requires the order to
be swapped since it uses column-major form:

```perl
pdl> $A = sequence(6)->reshape(2,3)
pdl> print $A
[
 [0 1]
 [2 3]
 [4 5]
]
```

Sometimes we want to flip the axes.  When we exchange a matrix's rows and
columns, the result is called its _transpose_.  Formally, we signify a matrix
$$\mathbf{A}$$'s transpose by $$\mathbf{A}^\top$$ and if $$\mathbf{B} =
\mathbf{A}^\top$$, then $$b_{ij} = a_{ji}$$ for all $$i$$ and $$j$$.  Thus, the
transpose of an $$m \times n$$ matrix is an $$n \times m$$ matrix:

$$
\mathbf{A}^\top =
\begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{21} & \dots  & a_{m1} \\
    a_{12} & a_{22} & \dots  & a_{m2} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots  & \vdots \\
    a_{1n} & a_{2n} & \dots  & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

In code, we can access _any matrix's transpose_ using the `transpose` function
as shown below:

```perl
pdl> print $A->transpose
[
 [0 2 4]
 [1 3 5]
]
```

Symmetric matrices are the subset of square matrices that are equal to their own
transposes:
$$\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}^\top$$.
The following matrix is symmetric:

```perl
pdl> $A = pdl([[1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 4], [3, 4, 5]])
pdl> print $A == $A->transpose

[
 [1 1 1]
 [1 1 1]
 [1 1 1]
]

```

Matrices are useful for representing datasets.  Typically, rows correspond to
individual records and columns correspond to distinct attributes.

## Tensors

While you can go far in your machine learning journey with only scalars,
vectors, and matrices, eventually you may need to work with higher-order
_tensors_.  Tensors give us a generic way of describing extensions to
$$n^{\textrm{th}}$$-order arrays. We call software objects of the _tensor
class_ "tensors" precisely because they too can have arbitrary numbers of axes.
While it may be confusing to use the word _tensor_ for both the mathematical
object and its realization in code, our meaning should usually be clear from
context.  We denote general tensors by capital letters with a special font face
(e.g., $$\mathsf{X}$$, $$\mathsf{Y}$$, and $$\mathsf{Z}$$) and their indexing
mechanism (e.g., $$x_{ijk}$$ and $$[\mathsf{X}]_{1, 2i-1, 3}$$) follows
naturally from that of matrices.

Tensors will become more important when we start working with images.  Each
image arrives as a $$3^{\textrm{rd}}$$-order tensor with axes corresponding to
the height, width, and _channel_.  At each spatial location, the intensities of
each color (red, green, and blue) are stacked along the channel.  Furthermore, a
collection of images is represented in code by a $$4^{\textrm{th}}$$-order
tensor, where distinct images are indexed along the first axis.  Higher-order
tensors are constructed, as were vectors and matrices, by growing the number of
shape components.

**NOTE**: In `PDL` the order of the parameters to `reshape` are reverse that of in
the `Python` equivalent.

```perl
pdl> print sequence(24)->reshape(4,3,2)
[
 [
  [ 0  1  2  3]
  [ 4  5  6  7]
  [ 8  9 10 11]
 ]
 [
  [12 13 14 15]
  [16 17 18 19]
  [20 21 22 23]
 ]
]

```

## Basic Properties of Tensor Arithmetic

Scalars, vectors, matrices, and higher-order tensors all have some handy
properties.  For example, elementwise operations produce outputs that have the
same shape as their operands.

```perl
pdl> $A = sequence(6)->reshape(3,2)
### Assign a copy of $A to $B by allocating new memory
pdl> $B = $A->copy
pdl> print $A, $A+$B

[
 [0 1 2]
 [3 4 5]
]
 
[
 [ 0  2  4]
 [ 6  8 10]
]
```

The elementwise product of two matrices is called their *Hadamard product*
(denoted $$\odot$$).  We can spell out the entries of the Hadamard product of
two matrices $$\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$$:



$$
\mathbf{A} \odot \mathbf{B} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11}  b_{11} & a_{12}  b_{12} & \dots  & a_{1n}  b_{1n} \\
    a_{21}  b_{21} & a_{22}  b_{22} & \dots  & a_{2n}  b_{2n} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    a_{m1}  b_{m1} & a_{m2}  b_{m2} & \dots  & a_{mn}  b_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

```perl
pdl> print $A * $B

[
 [ 0  1  4]
 [ 9 16 25]
]
```

Adding or multiplying a scalar and a tensor produces a result
with the same shape as the original tensor.
Here, each element of the tensor is added to (or multiplied by) the scalar.

```perl
pdl> print $a + $X, ($a * $X)->shape

[
 [
  [ 2  3  4  5]
  [ 6  7  8  9]
  [10 11 12 13]
 ]
 [
  [14 15 16 17]
  [18 19 20 21]
  [22 23 24 25]
 ]
]
 [4 3 2]

```

## Reduction

Often, we wish to calculate the sum of a tensor's elements.  To express the sum
of the elements in a vector $$\mathbf{x}$$ of length $$n$$, we write
$$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$. There is a simple function for it:

```perl
pdl> $x = sequence(3)
pdl> print $x, $x->sum
[0 1 2] 3
```

To express sums over the elements of tensors of arbitrary shape, we simply sum
over all its axes.  For example, the sum of the elements of an $$m \times n$$
matrix $$\mathbf{A}$$ could be written $$\sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}$$.

```perl
pdl> print $A

[
 [0 1 2]
 [3 4 5]
]

pdl> print $A->shape, $A->sum
[3 2] 15
```

By default, invoking the sum function _reduces_ a tensor along all of its axes,
eventually producing a scalar.  The `sumover` function allows us to specify the
axes along which the tensor should be reduced.  To sum over all elements along
the rows (dimension 0), we call `sumover` with no arguments.  Since the input
matrix reduces along dimension 0 to generate the output vector, this dimension
is missing from the shape of the output.

```perl
pdl> print $A->sumover, $A->sumover->shape
[3 12] [2]
```

If we want to reduce along the columns we call the `mv` function with the
dimension we want to swap and call `sumover` on that. Here we _move_ dimensions
0 and 1 and invoke `sumover` on the result.

```perl
pdl> print $A->mv(0,1)->sumover
[3 5 7]
## what the move looks like
pdl> print $A->mv(0,1)

[
 [0 3]
 [1 4]
 [2 5]
]
```

Another way is to use `transpose` with `sumover`.

```perl
pdl> print $A->transpose->sumover
[3 5 7]
```

Reducing a matrix along both rows and columns via summation is equivalent to
summing up all the elements of the matrix.

```perl
pdl> print $A->sumover
[3 12]
pdl> print $A->sumover->sum
15
```

A related quantity is the _mean_, also called the _average_.  We calculate the
mean by dividing the sum by the total number of elements.  Because computing the
mean is so common, it gets a dedicated library function that works analogously
to `sum`. In `PDL` this function is `avg`. Likewise, the function `average` can
also calculate the mean along specific dimensions.

```perl
pdl> print $A->avg
2.5
pdl> print $A->average
[1 4]
```

## Non-Reduction Sum

Sometimes it can be useful to keep the number of dimensions unchanged when
invoking the function for calculating the sum or mean. This matters when we
want to use the broadcast mechanism.

```perl
pdl> print $A
[
 [1 2 3]
 [2 0 4]
 [3 4 5]
]
pdl> print $A->sumover
[6 6 12]
pdl> $sumA = $A->sumover->transpose
pdl> print $sumA
[
 [ 6]
 [ 6]
 [12]
]
```

For instance, since `$sumA` keeps its two axes after summing each row, we can
divide `$A` by `$sumA` with broadcasting to create a matrix where each row sums
up to $$1$$.

```perl
pdl> print $A/$sumA

[
 [       0.16666667        0.33333333               0.5]
 [       0.33333333                 0        0.66666667]
 [             0.25        0.33333333        0.41666667]
]
 
```

If we want to calculate the cumulative sum of elements of `$A` along some axis,
say `dimension 0` (row by row), we can call the `cumusumover` function.
By design, this function does not reduce the input tensor along any axis.

```perl
pdl> print $A->cumusumover
[
 [ 1  3  6]
 [ 2  2  6]
 [ 3  7 12]
]
```

## Dot Products

So far, we have only performed elementwise operations, sums, and averages.
And if this was all we could do, linear algebra
would not deserve its own section.
Fortunately, this is where things get more interesting.
One of the most fundamental operations is the dot product.
Given two vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^d$,
their *dot product* $\mathbf{x}^\top \mathbf{y}$ (also known as *inner product*, $\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}  \rangle$)
is a sum over the products of the elements at the same position:
$\mathbf{x}^\top \mathbf{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{d} x_i y_i$.

[~~The *dot product* of two vectors is a sum over the products of the elements at the same position~~]

```{.python .input}
%%tab mxnet
y = np.ones(3)
x, y, np.dot(x, y)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab pytorch
y = torch.ones(3, dtype = torch.float32)
x, y, torch.dot(x, y)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab tensorflow
y = tf.ones(3, dtype=tf.float32)
x, y, tf.tensordot(x, y, axes=1)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab jax
y = jnp.ones(3, dtype = jnp.float32)
x, y, jnp.dot(x, y)
```

Equivalently, (**we can calculate the dot product of two vectors
by performing an elementwise multiplication followed by a sum:**)

```{.python .input}
%%tab mxnet
np.sum(x * y)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab pytorch
torch.sum(x * y)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab tensorflow
tf.reduce_sum(x * y)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab jax
jnp.sum(x * y)
```

Dot products are useful in a wide range of contexts.
For example, given some set of values,
denoted by a vector $\mathbf{x}  \in \mathbb{R}^n$,
and a set of weights, denoted by $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$,
the weighted sum of the values in $\mathbf{x}$
according to the weights $\mathbf{w}$
could be expressed as the dot product $\mathbf{x}^\top \mathbf{w}$.
When the weights are nonnegative
and sum to $1$, i.e., $\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} {w_i} = 1\right)$,
the dot product expresses a *weighted average*.
After normalizing two vectors to have unit length,
the dot products express the cosine of the angle between them.
Later in this section, we will formally introduce this notion of *length*.


## Matrix--Vector Products

Now that we know how to calculate dot products,
we can begin to understand the *product*
between an $m \times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$
and an $n$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{x}$.
To start off, we visualize our matrix
in terms of its row vectors

$$\mathbf{A}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{a}^\top_{1} \\
\mathbf{a}^\top_{2} \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{a}^\top_m \\
\end{bmatrix},$$

where each $\mathbf{a}^\top_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^n$
is a row vector representing the $i^\textrm{th}$ row
of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$.

[**The matrix--vector product $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$
is simply a column vector of length $m$,
whose $i^\textrm{th}$ element is the dot product
$\mathbf{a}^\top_i \mathbf{x}$:**]

$$
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}
= \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{a}^\top_{1} \\
\mathbf{a}^\top_{2} \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{a}^\top_m \\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{x}
= \begin{bmatrix}
 \mathbf{a}^\top_{1} \mathbf{x}  \\
 \mathbf{a}^\top_{2} \mathbf{x} \\
\vdots\\
 \mathbf{a}^\top_{m} \mathbf{x}\\
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

We can think of multiplication with a matrix
$\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$
as a transformation that projects vectors
from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{m}$.
These transformations are remarkably useful.
For example, we can represent rotations
as multiplications by certain square matrices.
Matrix--vector products also describe
the key calculation involved in computing
the outputs of each layer in a neural network
given the outputs from the previous layer.

:begin_tab:`mxnet`
To express a matrix--vector product in code,
we use the same `dot` function.
The operation is inferred
based on the type of the arguments.
Note that the column dimension of `A`
(its length along axis 1)
must be the same as the dimension of `x` (its length).
:end_tab:

:begin_tab:`pytorch`
To express a matrix--vector product in code,
we use the `mv` function.
Note that the column dimension of `A`
(its length along axis 1)
must be the same as the dimension of `x` (its length).
Python has a convenience operator `@`
that can execute both matrix--vector
and matrix--matrix products
(depending on its arguments).
Thus we can write `A@x`.
:end_tab:

:begin_tab:`tensorflow`
To express a matrix--vector product in code,
we use the `matvec` function.
Note that the column dimension of `A`
(its length along axis 1)
must be the same as the dimension of `x` (its length).
:end_tab:

```{.python .input}
%%tab mxnet
A.shape, x.shape, np.dot(A, x)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab pytorch
A.shape, x.shape, torch.mv(A, x), A@x
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab tensorflow
A.shape, x.shape, tf.linalg.matvec(A, x)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab jax
A.shape, x.shape, jnp.matmul(A, x)
```

## Matrix--Matrix Multiplication

Once you have gotten the hang of dot products and matrix--vector products,
then *matrix--matrix multiplication* should be straightforward.

Say that we have two matrices
$\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$
and $\mathbf{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times m}$:

$$\mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}
 a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1k} \\
 a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2k} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
 a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nk} \\
\end{bmatrix},\quad
\mathbf{B}=\begin{bmatrix}
 b_{11} & b_{12} & \cdots & b_{1m} \\
 b_{21} & b_{22} & \cdots & b_{2m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
 b_{k1} & b_{k2} & \cdots & b_{km} \\
\end{bmatrix}.$$


Let $\mathbf{a}^\top_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^k$ denote
the row vector representing the $i^\textrm{th}$ row
of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$
and let $\mathbf{b}_{j} \in \mathbb{R}^k$ denote
the column vector from the $j^\textrm{th}$ column
of the matrix $\mathbf{B}$:

$$\mathbf{A}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{a}^\top_{1} \\
\mathbf{a}^\top_{2} \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{a}^\top_n \\
\end{bmatrix},
\quad \mathbf{B}=\begin{bmatrix}
 \mathbf{b}_{1} & \mathbf{b}_{2} & \cdots & \mathbf{b}_{m} \\
\end{bmatrix}.
$$


To form the matrix product $\mathbf{C} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$,
we simply compute each element $c_{ij}$
as the dot product between
the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ row of $\mathbf{A}$
and the $j^{\textrm{th}}$ column of $\mathbf{B}$,
i.e., $\mathbf{a}^\top_i \mathbf{b}_j$:

$$\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{AB} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{a}^\top_{1} \\
\mathbf{a}^\top_{2} \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{a}^\top_n \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
 \mathbf{b}_{1} & \mathbf{b}_{2} & \cdots & \mathbf{b}_{m} \\
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{a}^\top_{1} \mathbf{b}_1 & \mathbf{a}^\top_{1}\mathbf{b}_2& \cdots & \mathbf{a}^\top_{1} \mathbf{b}_m \\
 \mathbf{a}^\top_{2}\mathbf{b}_1 & \mathbf{a}^\top_{2} \mathbf{b}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{a}^\top_{2} \mathbf{b}_m \\
 \vdots & \vdots & \ddots &\vdots\\
\mathbf{a}^\top_{n} \mathbf{b}_1 & \mathbf{a}^\top_{n}\mathbf{b}_2& \cdots& \mathbf{a}^\top_{n} \mathbf{b}_m
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

[**We can think of the matrix--matrix multiplication $\mathbf{AB}$
as performing $m$ matrix--vector products
or $m \times n$ dot products
and stitching the results together
to form an $n \times m$ matrix.**]
In the following snippet,
we perform matrix multiplication on `A` and `B`.
Here, `A` is a matrix with two rows and three columns,
and `B` is a matrix with three rows and four columns.
After multiplication, we obtain a matrix with two rows and four columns.

```{.python .input}
%%tab mxnet
B = np.ones(shape=(3, 4))
np.dot(A, B)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab pytorch
B = torch.ones(3, 4)
torch.mm(A, B), A@B
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab tensorflow
B = tf.ones((3, 4), tf.float32)
tf.matmul(A, B)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab jax
B = jnp.ones((3, 4))
jnp.matmul(A, B)
```

The term *matrix--matrix multiplication* is
often simplified to *matrix multiplication*,
and should not be confused with the Hadamard product.


## Norms

Some of the most useful operators in linear algebra are *norms*.
Informally, the norm of a vector tells us how *big* it is.
For instance, the $\ell_2$ norm measures
the (Euclidean) length of a vector.
Here, we are employing a notion of *size* that concerns the magnitude of a vector's components
(not its dimensionality).

A norm is a function $\| \cdot \|$ that maps a vector
to a scalar and satisfies the following three properties:

1. Given any vector $\mathbf{x}$, if we scale (all elements of) the vector
   by a scalar $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, its norm scales accordingly:
   $$\|\alpha \mathbf{x}\| = |\alpha| \|\mathbf{x}\|.$$
2. For any vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$:
   norms satisfy the triangle inequality:
   $$\|\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}\| \leq \|\mathbf{x}\| + \|\mathbf{y}\|.$$
3. The norm of a vector is nonnegative and it only vanishes if the vector is zero:
   $$\|\mathbf{x}\| > 0 \textrm{ for all } \mathbf{x} \neq 0.$$

Many functions are valid norms and different norms
encode different notions of size.
The Euclidean norm that we all learned in elementary school geometry
when calculating the hypotenuse of a right triangle
is the square root of the sum of squares of a vector's elements.
Formally, this is called [**the $\ell_2$ *norm***] and expressed as

(**$$\|\mathbf{x}\|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}.$$**)

The method `norm` calculates the $\ell_2$ norm.

```{.python .input}
%%tab mxnet
u = np.array([3, -4])
np.linalg.norm(u)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab pytorch
u = torch.tensor([3.0, -4.0])
torch.norm(u)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab tensorflow
u = tf.constant([3.0, -4.0])
tf.norm(u)
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab jax
u = jnp.array([3.0, -4.0])
jnp.linalg.norm(u)
```

[**The $\ell_1$ norm**] is also common
and the associated measure is called the Manhattan distance.
By definition, the $\ell_1$ norm sums
the absolute values of a vector's elements:

(**$$\|\mathbf{x}\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n \left|x_i \right|.$$**)

Compared to the $\ell_2$ norm, it is less sensitive to outliers.
To compute the $\ell_1$ norm,
we compose the absolute value
with the sum operation.

```{.python .input}
%%tab mxnet
np.abs(u).sum()
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab pytorch
torch.abs(u).sum()
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab tensorflow
tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(u))
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab jax
jnp.linalg.norm(u, ord=1) # same as jnp.abs(u).sum()
```

Both the $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ norms are special cases
of the more general $\ell_p$ *norms*:

$$\|\mathbf{x}\|_p = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \left|x_i \right|^p \right)^{1/p}.$$

In the case of matrices, matters are more complicated.
After all, matrices can be viewed both as collections of individual entries
*and* as objects that operate on vectors and transform them into other vectors.
For instance, we can ask by how much longer
the matrix--vector product $\mathbf{X} \mathbf{v}$
could be relative to $\mathbf{v}$.
This line of thought leads to what is called the *spectral* norm.
For now, we introduce [**the *Frobenius norm*,
which is much easier to compute**] and defined as
the square root of the sum of the squares
of a matrix's elements:

[**$$\|\mathbf{X}\|_\textrm{F} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij}^2}.$$**]

The Frobenius norm behaves as if it were
an $\ell_2$ norm of a matrix-shaped vector.
Invoking the following function will calculate
the Frobenius norm of a matrix.

```{.python .input}
%%tab mxnet
np.linalg.norm(np.ones((4, 9)))
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab pytorch
torch.norm(torch.ones((4, 9)))
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab tensorflow
tf.norm(tf.ones((4, 9)))
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab jax
jnp.linalg.norm(jnp.ones((4, 9)))
```

While we do not want to get too far ahead of ourselves,
we already can plant some intuition about why these concepts are useful.
In deep learning, we are often trying to solve optimization problems:
*maximize* the probability assigned to observed data;
*maximize* the revenue associated with a recommender model;
*minimize* the distance between predictions
and the ground truth observations;
*minimize* the distance between representations
of photos of the same person
while *maximizing* the distance between representations
of photos of different people.
These distances, which constitute
the objectives of deep learning algorithms,
are often expressed as norms.


## Discussion

In this section, we have reviewed all the linear algebra
that you will need to understand
a significant chunk of modern deep learning.
There is a lot more to linear algebra, though,
and much of it is useful for machine learning.
For example, matrices can be decomposed into factors,
and these decompositions can reveal
low-dimensional structure in real-world datasets.
There are entire subfields of machine learning
that focus on using matrix decompositions
and their generalizations to high-order tensors
to discover structure in datasets
and solve prediction problems.
But this book focuses on deep learning.
And we believe you will be more inclined
to learn more mathematics
once you have gotten your hands dirty
applying machine learning to real datasets.
So while we reserve the right
to introduce more mathematics later on,
we wrap up this section here.

If you are eager to learn more linear algebra,
there are many excellent books and online resources.
For a more advanced crash course, consider checking out
:citet:`Strang.1993`, :citet:`Kolter.2008`, and :citet:`Petersen.Pedersen.ea.2008`.

To recap:

* Scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors are
  the basic mathematical objects used in linear algebra
  and have zero, one, two, and an arbitrary number of axes, respectively.
* Tensors can be sliced or reduced along specified axes
  via indexing, or operations such as `sum` and `mean`, respectively.
* Elementwise products are called Hadamard products.
  By contrast, dot products, matrix--vector products, and matrix--matrix products
  are not elementwise operations and in general return objects
  having shapes that are different from the the operands.
* Compared to Hadamard products, matrix--matrix products
  take considerably longer to compute (cubic rather than quadratic time).
* Norms capture various notions of the magnitude of a vector (or matrix),
  and are commonly applied to the difference of two vectors
  to measure their distance apart.
* Common vector norms include the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms,
   and common matrix norms include the *spectral* and *Frobenius* norms.


## Exercises
